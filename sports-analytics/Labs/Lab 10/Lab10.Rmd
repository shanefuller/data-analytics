## Overview

Spline terms are non-linear regression terms that are often able to more flexibly model the relationship between X and Y. Today, we'll implement a few spline models to better understand how they operate.

## Baseball example

Let's return to our baseball example.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(Lahman)
head(Batting)

Batting_1 <- Batting %>% 
  filter(yearID >= 1970, yearID <= 2000, AB >= 500) %>% 
  mutate(X1B = H - X2B - X3B - HR, 
         TB = X1B + 2*X2B + 3*X3B + 4*HR, 
         RC = (H + BB)*TB/(AB + BB))

birth_years <- Master %>% 
  select(playerID, birthYear)

Batting_2 <- Batting_1 %>% inner_join(birth_years) 

Batting_2 <- Batting_2 %>% 
  mutate(age = yearID - birthYear, 
         age_sq = age^2)

ggplot(Batting_2, aes(x = age)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)

ggplot(Batting_2, aes(x = age, y = RC)) + 
  geom_line(aes(group = playerID)) + 
  geom_point(aes(group = playerID)) + 
  geom_smooth()
```

1. Describe the distribution of player age -- it's center, shape, and spread

*The range is from about 45 years to 19 years, so about 26 years. The center seems to be set around 28 years, and the shape is relatively normal, with a bit of a right skew.*

2. Roughly, describe the relationship between age and runs created. Additionally, identify one limitation of this data set with respect to answering this question.

*There is a slight positive correlation between age and RC, however the correlation becomes slightly negative around age 33.*

Our interest lies in the assocation between age and runs created. Let's propose a few models. But instead of evaluating performance within a sample, let's split the data into training and testing data. 

```{r}
set.seed(0)
Batting_2$random_id <- rnorm(nrow(Batting_2))

training_data <- Batting_2 %>% 
  filter(random_id < 0)

test_data <- Batting_2 %>% 
  filter(random_id > 0)

dim(training_data)
dim(test_data)
dim(Batting_2)
```

3. Provide the primary benefits to evaluating models in data that the model is not fit on.

*Having test and training data ensures that the model is actually doing a good job at finding the trend, rather than just attempting to find the best results (learning the data).*

Let's try some models.

```{r}
library(splines)

fit1 <- lm(RC ~ age, data = training_data)
fit2 <- lm(RC ~ age_sq + age, data = training_data)
fit3 <- lm(RC ~ ns(age, 4), data = training_data)
fit4 <- lm(RC ~ ns(age, 8), data = training_data)
```

4. As judged by AIC, which model above is best? 

```{r}
AIC(fit1)
AIC(fit2)
AIC(fit3)
AIC(fit4)
```

*Fit3 is the best model.*

Let's see what predictions look like in a new data set. That is, how would our model do in the test data?

```{r}
test_data <- test_data %>% 
  mutate(RC_hat_fit1 = predict(fit1, test_data), 
         RC_hat_fit2 = predict(fit2, test_data), 
         RC_hat_fit3 = predict(fit3, test_data), 
         RC_hat_fit4 = predict(fit4, test_data))

test_data %>% slice(1)

Batting %>% 
  filter(playerID == 'aaronha01', yearID == 1971)
```

5. For the player listed above -- Hank Aaron, in 1970 -- which prediction was closest to his actual runs created? 

*Fit1 happened to be the best, but Hank Aaron was also a unique player.*

6. Calculate the MSE and MAE for each of the four fits above, using the test data.

*MSE for fit1 is, and MAE is. MSE for fit2 is, and MAE is. MSE for fit3 is, and MAE is. MSE for fit4 is, and MAE is.*

7. Use some baseball specific knowledge -- what's definitely a variable needed to improve an age curve?

*Position would help with this curve, as some positions can yield players for longer.*

## Splines with logistic regression

We return to our hockey data set to close out the lab. Recall, the shot data provided from the last two NHL seasons.

```{r}
library(RCurl); library(tidyverse)
githubURL <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/statsbylopez/StatsSports/master/Data/pbp_data_hockey.rds"
pbp_data <- readRDS(gzcon(url(githubURL)))
names(pbp_data)
```

Spline terms also operate well with logistic regression. In this case, we'll propose a few candidate models based on the distance of the shot.

```{r}
library(splines)
pbp_data <- pbp_data %>% 
  mutate(dist_sq = event_distance^2)
fit0 <- glm(event_type == "GOAL" ~ event_distance + dist_sq, family = "binomial", data = pbp_data)
fit1 <- glm(event_type == "GOAL" ~ ns(event_distance, 5), family = "binomial", data = pbp_data)
fit2 <- glm(event_type == "GOAL" ~ ns(event_distance, 10), family = "binomial", data = pbp_data)
```

8. Use AIC to pick your favorite model above. 

```{r}
AIC(fit0)
AIC(fit1)
AIC(fit2)
```

*Fit2 is my favorite.*

9. Next, use Hosmer Lemeshow to identify if there is any lack of fit in `fit0`. Code for the HL test is provided below for `fit0`. 

```{r}
pbp_data$shot_hat <- predict(fit0, pbp_data, type = "response")

tab_check <- pbp_data %>% 
  mutate(shot_cat = cut(shot_hat, 10)) %>% 
  group_by(shot_cat) %>% 
  summarise(ave_exp_goals = sum(shot_hat), 
            ave_act_goals = sum(event_type == "GOAL"), 
            n_shots = n())

tab_check <- tab_check %>% 
  mutate(diff_sq = (ave_exp_goals - ave_act_goals)^2/
           ((ave_exp_goals)))
tab_check

hm_test <- tab_check %>% 
  summarise(test_stat = sum(diff_sq))
hm_test

1-pchisq(hm_test$test_stat, df = 8, lower.tail = TRUE)
```

10. Repeat question 9, using `fit1` and `fit2` (do separately). What does this suggest about the spline term?
