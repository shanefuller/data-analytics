## Overview

In this lab, we'll try and build models to predict player performance in the following season. We're going to start by using the `Batting` data.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(Lahman)
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r, eval = FALSE}
Batting_1 <- Batting %>% 
  filter(yearID >= 1970, AB >= 500) %>% 
  mutate(K_rate = SO/(AB + BB), 
         BB_rate = BB/(AB + BB), 
         BA = H/AB, 
         HR_rate = HR/(AB + BB),
         X1B = H - X2B - X3B - HR, 
         TB = X1B + 2*X2B + 3*X3B + 4*HR, 
         RC = (H + BB)*TB/(AB + BB))

Batting_1 <- Batting_1 %>% 
  arrange(playerID, yearID) %>% 
  group_by(playerID) %>% 
  mutate(RC_next = lead(RC), 
         lgID_next = lead(lgID)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(RC_next)) %>% 
  ungroup()

head(Batting_1)
```

## Categorical variables

The following code creates categories for hitters based on the number of stolen bases they record in a season.

```{r}
Batting_1 <- Batting_1 %>% 
  mutate(SB_category = case_when(SB > 25 ~ "Fast", 
                                 SB > 5 ~ "Moderate", 
                                 SB <= 5 ~ "Slow"))

Batting_1 %>% count(SB_category)
```

The `count()` command creates a table with the frequencies of batters in each category.

A coach fits the following regression model

```{r}
fit_run <- lm(RC ~ BB_rate + HR_rate + K_rate + SB_category, data = Batting_1)
summary(fit_run)
```

1. Interpret the coefficient on walk rate. *Note*: it's difficult to interpret, so instead of considering a 1 unit increase, consider a 0.01 (1 percent) unit increase.

*With every 1 percent unit increase in walk rate, there is an expected increase in runs created by about 1.799 units, given the other variables in the model.* 

2. Interpret the coefficients `SB_categoryModerate` and `SB_categorySlow`. 

*Players who are moderately fast are expected to score about 5.33 runs lesss in the runs created category. Players who are slow are expected to create about 10.823 less runs than players who are fast.*

3. Consider the context in baseball -- what do you think is responsible for the coefficients you are observing in Question 2.

*The runs created variable is interested in the ability to convert runs, therefore baserunners who can move around the bases quicker and who can be more agressive on the basepath are more likely to contribute to the number of runs scored in a game.*

## Comparing multiple regression models. 

Ultimately, baseball coaches are tasked with predicting performance in the following season. Our goal today is to predict runs created in the next year `RC_next`. 

4. Use several scatter plots to estimate how a few variables are linked to `RC_next`.

```{r}
ggplot(data = Batting_1, aes(x = yearID, y = RC_next)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
ggplot(data = Batting_1, aes(x = BB_rate, y = RC_next)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
ggplot(data = Batting_1, aes(x = HR_rate, y = RC_next)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
ggplot(data = Batting_1, aes(x = K_rate, y = RC_next)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
ggplot(data = Batting_1, aes(x = SB, y = RC_next)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
ggplot(data = Batting_1, aes(x = BA, y = RC_next)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
```


5. Create several multivariate regression models, using any set of input to guide you. your outcome must be `RC_next`. 

```{r}
RC_fit_1 <- lm(RC_next ~ RC, data = Batting_1)
dim(Batting_1)
RC_fit_2 <- lm(RC_next ~ BB_rate + HR_rate + K_rate + H + X2B + X3B + X1B + RC, data = Batting_1)
```


6. Evaluate the models in No. 4 using the AIC criterion.

```{r}
AIC(RC_fit_1)
AIC(RC_fit_2)
```


7. For the model with the lowest AIC in No. 5, generate a set of predictions for each player. Call these predictions `RC_next_predict`.

```{r}
#Batting_1$RC_next_predict <- predict(RC_fit_2, Batting_1)

Batting_1 <- Batting_1 %>%
  mutate(RC_next_predict = predict(RC_fit_2, Batting_1))
```


8. The first row in `Batting_1` is Bobby Abreau, and it corresponds to the 1999 season. In the 2000 season, Abreau's `RC_next = 133.074`. What is your prediction (`RC_next_predict`) for Abreau in that season?

```{r}
Batting_1 %>% slice(1) %>% print.data.frame()
```

*The prediction is about 115.085 runs.*

9. See our lecture notes -- calculate the mean absolute error and mean squared error for the entire set of `RC_next_predict`. You should only be doing this for one model. 

```{r}
Batting_1 %>%
  filter(!is.na(RC_next_predict)) %>%
  summarise(mae_p1 = mean(abs(RC_next - RC_next_predict)))

Batting_1 %>%
  filter(!is.na(RC_next_predict)) %>%
  summarise(mae_p1 = mean(abs(RC_next - RC_next_predict))^2)
```


10. Interpret the mean absolute error in No. 9. What does it say about your runs created predictions?

*On average, there is an expected absolute difference between the predicted runs created for next season the actual runs created for next season.*

11. Compare the distribution of your entire set of `RC_next_predict` values to the observed `RC_next` values using a scatter plot. What does this say about the appropriateness of your model?

```{r}
ggplot(data = Batting_1, aes(RC_next, RC_next_predict)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(model = "lm")
```

## Linear models with non-linear terms

The association between home run rate (`HR_rate`) and `RC_next` is kind of funky.

```{r}
ggplot(Batting_1, aes(HR_rate, RC_next)) + geom_point()
ggplot(Batting_1, aes(HR_rate, RC_next)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() 
ggplot(Batting_1, aes(HR_rate, RC_next)) + geom_smooth()
```

One way to account for the curved nature of the association is to include a quadratic term in the regression model.

```{r}
fit_1 <- lm(RC_next ~ HR_rate, data = Batting_1)

Batting_1 <- Batting_1 %>% 
  mutate(HR_rate_sq = HR_rate^2)

fit_2 <- lm(RC_next ~ HR_rate + HR_rate_sq, data = Batting_1)
library(broom)
tidy(fit_2)
```

12. Does it make sense to include the quadratic term in the model? 

13. Why is the coefficient on the quadratic term negative?

14. Can the coefficient on `HR_rate` be interpreted as we usually do it?
